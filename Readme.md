## 🧾 Overview

**Student Academic Performance Analysis** is a data analytics project designed to help educators and academic institutions evaluate and visualize students' academic progress using **Python**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**.

The analysis focuses on comparing performances across semesters and subjects, identifying trends, and deriving insights that can assist in improving teaching strategies and student outcomes.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Analyze and visualize student performance using descriptive statistics.  
- Compare class-wise and subject-wise performance.  
- Identify correlations between attendance, practicals, and exam scores.  
- Perform inferential statistics (e.g., hypothesis testing) to derive insights.  

---

## 📊 Features

- 📈 Mean, median, and standard deviation calculations.  
- 🧩 Interactive Power BI dashboard for visual exploration.  
- 🧮 Correlation and trend analysis.  
- 🔍 Subject-wise and semester-wise comparisons.  
- 🧑‍🏫 Insights for teachers to understand class-level performance distribution.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Tool / Language | Purpose |
|-----------------|----------|
| **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)** | Data analysis and visualization |
| **Excel** | Dataset preparation and preprocessing |
| **Power BI** | Interactive dashboards |
| **Jupyter Notebook** | Code execution and exploration |

## 📁 Dataset Details

- **BSc1DADataSetFinal.xlsx** → Academic data for **B.Sc. 1st Year**
- **BSc2DADatasetFinal.xlsx** → Academic data for **B.Sc. 2nd Year**

Each dataset includes:
- Roll Number  
- Mid-Sem Marks  
- End-Sem Marks  
- Practical Marks  
- Attendance Percentage  

---

## 📈 Example Insights

- Relationship between **attendance** and **academic performance**.  
- Comparison of **average marks** between years or subjects.  
- Identification of **outliers** and **consistently high/low performers**.  
- Hypothesis testing on performance differences.  

---

## 🧮 Sample Visuals

- Bar charts for subject-wise comparison  
- Pie charts for attendance distribution  
- Box plots for marks dispersion  
- Power BI dashboards for interactive analytics  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Integration of **machine learning models** to predict student performance.  
- Addition of **department-level analytics** for broader insights.  
- Deployment as a **web dashboard** for teachers to interact with data online.
